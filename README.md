And the javascript `js/rescuetime.js`


###Request
To do an API request, you need an `api-key`. Get one [here]( https://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/setup ).
Create a new request object:
		$rt_request = new RescueTimeRequest( $apikey );
and use one or more of the following functions to manipulate the request:
- `set_perspective`: Sets the perspective (rank, member, interval)
- `set_resolution`: Sets the resolution (hour, week, day, month)
- `set_startdate`: Sets the start date restriction
- `set_enddate`: Sets the end date restriction 
- `restrict_user`: Restricts to a certain user name or e-mail
- `restrict_group`: Restricts to a certain group name
- `restrict_kind`: Restricts to a certain kind
- `restrict_project`: Restricts to a certain project
- `restrict_thing`: Restricts to a certain taxonomy
- `restrict_thingy`: Restricts to a certain sub-taxonomy
The function calls are chainable, so you can:
		$rt_request->set_perspective( 'interval' )->set_resolution( 'hour' )->restrict_user( 'derk-jan@karrenbeld.info' );
When you are ready call the execute command:
		$rt_result = $rt_request->execute();
The request object is re-usable.
		
###Result
You can manipulate the result, as long as the request was valid:
		$rt_result->is_error(); //checks if the result has data
The data returned is tabular and the headers are provided seperately from the rows. Access those:
- `get_rows`: Gets the raw row data
- `get_row_headers`: Gets the row headers

You can `GROUP BY` by issuing one of the `get_by` commands. Does not manipulate the data:
- `get_rows_by_activity`: Group per activity
- `get_rows_by_category`: Group per category
- `get_rows_by_productivity`: Group per productivity value
- `get_rows_by_person`: Group per person (only valid with perspective member)
- `get_rows_by_date`: Group per date (only valid with perspective interval)

You can `WHERE` data by issuing one of the `get_with` commands. Simply provide one value or an array of valid values. Does not manipulate the data:
- `get_rows_with_rank`: Gets a row with a rank (only valid with perspective rank)
- `get_rows_with_activity`: Gets rows with that activity
- `get_rows_with_category`: Gets rows with that category
- `get_rows_with_productivity`: Gets rows with that productivity
- `get_rows_with_person`: Gets rows with that person (only valid with perspective member)
- `get_rows_between_time`: Gets rows between min and max time spent

You can filter data just like `WHERE` issuing one of the `filter` commands. Same arguments as the `get_with` are valid. **Note:** you don't get a subsection of rows back. Instead a new `RescueTimeResult` object is created with the subsection of data:
- `filter_time`: Filters the data on rows between min and max time spent
- `filter_min_time`: Filters the data on rows at least time spent
- `filter_max_time`: Filters the data on rows at most time spent
- `filter_activity`: Filters the data on rows with that activity
- `filter_category`: Filters the data on rows with that category
- `filter_productivity`: Filters the data on rows with that productivity
- `filter_unproductive`: Filters data to only unproductive rows
- `filter_productive`: Filters data to only productive rows
- `filter_person` : Filters rows for that person (only valid with perspective member)
